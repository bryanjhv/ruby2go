# Ruby2Go

Run Ruby in your Firefox OS smartphone.

## Contributing

I'm using Bower and Gulp, so grab these before proceeding.

1.  Fork and clone the project.
2.  Install bower dependencies (run `bower install`).
3.  Make your changes inside `app` folder.
4.  Create the package (run `gulp`), generates `dist` folder and `package.zip`.
5.  Test your changes with the WebIDE.
6.  Submit a pull request to this repository.

For now, I **need contributions about**:

- New features. (specially Firefox OS specific ones)
- Bug fixing. (but only tested on real devices)
- Better UI. (better if it matches Mozilla patterns)
- Faster compilation. (current takes about a second)
- Cross-browser support. (for the future)
- Testing.
